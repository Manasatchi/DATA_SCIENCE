Exploratory Data Analysis in Python:

      Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a critical initial step in the data science workflow. It involves using Python libraries to inspect, summarize, and visualize data to uncover trends, patterns, and relationships. Here’s a breakdown of the key steps in performing EDA with Python:

1. Importing Libraries:

      pandas (pd): For data manipulation and analysis.
      NumPy (np): For numerical computations.
      Matplotlib.pyplot (plt): For basic plotting functionalities.
      Seaborn (sns): A built-on top of Matplotlib, providing high-level visualization.

2. Loading the Data:

      Use pd.read_csv() for CSV files, similar functions exist for other data formats (e.g., .xlsx, .json).

3. Initial Inspection:

      Get an overview of the data using df.head(), .tail(), and .info().
      Check data types with df.dtypes.

4. Data Cleaning:

      Identify and handle missing values using methods like df.isnull().sum().
      Find and address duplicates with df.duplicated().sum().

5. Univariate Analysis:

      Analyze single variables at a time.
      Use descriptive statistics with df.describe() for numerical data.
      Create histograms, box plots, and density plots to visualize distributions.

6. Bivariate Analysis:

      Explore relationships between two variables.
      Create scatter plots to identify trends and potential correlations.

7. Visualization:

      Effective visualizations are crucial for understanding data.
      Use various plots like bar charts, pie charts, and heatmaps to represent categorical data.

Conclusion:

      In conclusion, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is crucial for understanding datasets, identifying patterns, and informing subsequent analysis. Data pre-processing and feature engineering are essential steps in preparing data for analysis, involving tasks such as data reduction, cleaning, and transformation. Python libraries offer powerful tools for executing these steps efficiently.Also, in the article we talk about how eda using python and you can make to it we showed a complete guide for that.
      
      Also,In this article, we tried to analyze the factors influencing the used car’s price.
      
      Data Analysis helps to find the basic structure of the dataset.
      Dropped columns that are not adding value to our analysis.
      Performed Feature Engineering by adding some columns which contribute to our analysis.
      Data Transformations have been used to normalize the columns.
      We used different visualizations for Exploratory data analysis (EDA) like Univariate, Bi-Variate, and Multivariate Analysis.
      Through EDA, we got useful insights, and below are the factors influencing the price of the car and a few takeaways:

      Most of the customers prefer 2 Seat cars hence the price of the 2-seat cars is higher than other cars.
      The price of the car decreases as the Age of the car increases.
      Customers prefer to purchase the First owner rather than the Second or Third.
      Due to increased Fuel price, the customer prefers to purchase an Electric vehicle.
      Automatic Transmission is easier than Manual.
      This way, we perform EDA on the datasets to explore the data and extract all possible insights, which can help in model building and better decision making.
      
      However, this was only an overview of how EDA works; you can go deeper into it and attempt the stages on larger datasets.
      
      If the EDA process is clear and precise, our model will work better and gives higher accuracy!
