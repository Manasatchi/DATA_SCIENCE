Financial Market Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning
Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of analyzing financial news articles and extracting sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral). By understanding the prevailing sentiment in the market, investors can make more informed decisions.

Key Features
Data Collection: Gathering financial news articles from reputable sources using web scraping techniques.
Text Preprocessing: Cleaning and normalizing the text data, including tasks like tokenization, stemming, and stop word removal.
Feature Extraction: Converting text data into numerical features using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).   
Model Training: Building and training a machine learning model (e.g., Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Recurrent Neural Networks) on the preprocessed data to classify sentiment.
Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Creating visualizations to interpret the model's predictions and understand the impact of different features on sentiment.
